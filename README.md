# Palindrome Checker in Java

This project contains a simple Java program that checks if a word entered by the user is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

## How the Program Works

The program prompts the user to enter a word. It then uses a `Stack` to reverse the word by pushing each character onto the stack and then popping them off into a new string. Finally, it compares the original string to the reversed string to determine if the word is a palindrome.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile the Java program using `javac`:

    ```bash
    javac PalindromeTest.java
    ```

3. Run the compiled class with the Java interpreter:

    ```bash
    java excercise.PalindromeTest
    ```

Follow the prompt and enter a word of your choice. The program will then tell you if the word is a palindrome.
